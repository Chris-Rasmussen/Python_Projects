##Project #1
- https://github.com/Chris-Rasmussen/Project_1
- This project was designed to take a problem that interests us, analyze a data set, and create results. For this, I did a data analysis of the top listened to artists on Spotify and found who has the most listened to songs on the platform, those artists streams per day, and overall who rules the Spotify charts.
##Project #2
- https://github.com/Chris-Rasmussen/Project_2
- This project was designed to explore three different python libraries and their abilities. For this, we did pygame, phue, and music21.
##Project #3
- https://github.com/Chris-Rasmussen/Project_3
- This project was designed to take a problem that is affecting the people of New Jersey and create a software to solve it. For this, we did a weather prediction software using machine learning with data from the NOAA.
